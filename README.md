Welcome to the Simple Interest Calculator project! This repository hosts a basic yet essential script for calculating simple interest, created to assist micro-finance teams and open to contributions from the community. Our goal is to develop tools that support financial literacy and empowerment for low-income individuals.

The Simple Interest Calculator is designed to calculate simple interest based on the principal, rate, and time period inputs. The tool is aimed at individuals and teams working in finance, education, and community support projects.

Principal (P): The initial amount of money.
Rate of Interest (R): The percentage interest rate per time period.
Time (T): The number of time periods the money is invested or borrowed for.
